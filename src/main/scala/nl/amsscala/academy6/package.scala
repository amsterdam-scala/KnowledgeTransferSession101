/**
 * A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a ratio n/d, where n and d are integers,
 * except that d cannot be zero. n is called the numerator and d the denominator.
 * Examples of rational numbers are 1/2, 2/3, 112/239, and 2/1.
 * Compared to floating-point numbers, rational numbers have the advantage
 * that fractions are represented exactly, without rounding or approximation.
